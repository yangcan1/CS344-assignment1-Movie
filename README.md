# OSU-CS344-Assgn1-Movies instruction

This is a program that:
Reads a CSV file with movie data that is provided to the program as an argument
Processes the data in the file to create structs to hold data for each movie
Creates a linked list of all these structs
Gives user choices to ask questions about the movies in the data
Prints out the data about the movies per user choice

## Process the input file
When your program starts it must read all data from the file and process it. After processing the file, the program must print the following message to stdout

"Processed file XYZ and parsed data for M movies"

where XYZ is the name of the file that has been process and M is the number of movies whose data has been processed (this will be 1 less than than the number of lines in the file because the first line has the column headers).

E.g., Processed file movies_sample_1.csv and parsed data for 24 movies

# Format of the CSV File
The first line in the input file will be the header line containing the column headers (i.e., it will not have data for a movie).
All the other lines will have the data for a movie in valid format and no columns will be missing.
The file will not have any empty lines.
The file will contain data for at least one movie.
Don't assume a maximum number of movies in the file.
Commas appear as delimiters between columns, but will not appear in the values of any columns.
The name of the input file will be less than 50 characters and will not contain any spaces.
Don't assume that the input file name will have a particular extension.

## This file has the following columns:

### 1.Title
This is a string with the movie title. 
E.g., Iron Man 2
You cannot assume a maximum length of the movie title.
### 2. Year
This is a 4 digit integer value for the year the movie was released
It's value will be between 1900 and 2021 (inclusive of these years).
E.g., 2010
### 3. Languages
The language or languages in which the movie was released.
One or more string values that are always enclosed within []
Multiple values are separated by semi-colons.
E.g,
[English;Portuguese;Spanish]
[English;French]
[English]
You can assume that the maximum number of languages any movie can be released in is 5.
You can assume that the maximum length of a particular language is 20 characters.
You cannot assume any particular case for the letters in the language.
E.g., don't assume that the first letter is upper case, or that all letters are lowercase.
### 4.Rating Value
A number between 1 and 10 (inclusive of both 1 and 10)
It can be an integer or a double with one digit after the decimal point
E.g: 5, 8.7

# Program Functionality

## Process the input file
When your program starts it must read all data from the file and process it. After processing the file, the program must print the following message to stdout

"Processed file XYZ and parsed data for M movies"

where XYZ is the name of the file that has been process and M is the number of movies whose data has been processed (this will be 1 less than than the number of lines in the file because the first line has the column headers).

E.g., Processed file movies_sample_1.csv and parsed data for 24 movies

## Interactive Functionality

Next your program should display a menus of interactive choices to the user and process the selected choice as described below. For the text of messages to print, see the section "Sample Program Execution."

For the interaction choice if  the user enters an incorrect integer (i.e., something other than 1 to 4), print an error message and again present the 4 choices to the user. 

### 1.Show movies released in a specified year

If the user chooses this option, then ask them to enter a year and
Display the names of all the movies released in that year, one on each line
If the data doesn't have any movies released in that year, print a message about this. 

Your program can assume that the user will enter a 4 digit integer for the year between 1900 and 2021 (inclusive of these years)

### 2. Show highest rated movie for each year

If the user chooses this option, then for each year for which at least one movie was released, display a movie that had the highest rating along with the year and the rating with one line per year.
  In case of ties, display any one movie that had the highest rating that year.
Display the data in the form: YYYY RatingValue MovieTitle
The data doesn't have to be sorted by year or by rating value.
E.g.,
  2010 8.5 Avengers: Infinity War
  2012 8.1 The Avengers
  
### 3.Show movies and their year of release for a specific language

If the user chooses this option, ask them to enter a language and
For all movies released in the specified language
Display the year of release and the movie title, one line per movie
If the data doesn't include any movie released in this language, print a message about it.
You should only do an exact match on the language entered by the user
E.g., "English" shouldn’t match "english"
You can assume that the length of the language string entered by the user will be less than 20 character.

### 4. Exit

If the user choose this option, the program should exit.
